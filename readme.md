# Everywhere search

## Introduction
I started this project after swurl.com went down as an attempt to revive it.


## Features
- Search DuckDuckGo, Youtube, Reddit, and Github on one page.
- Discover unrelated information. 

## How to run?

```cmd
npm run start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and type in search box.

It also has an Json api which could be accessed through `http://localhost:3000/api/search`
